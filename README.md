# -What-are-the-early-signs-of-infertility-in-women-and-men-

Infertility signs are not always clear, but there are few common ones. In women, if periods are irregular, delayed, or missing for months, that can be one early sign. Also, if you have very painful periods, heavy bleeding or PCOS, it may affect ovulation.

Another common sign is trying for pregnancy for 1 year and still not getting pregnant. Women with thyroid issues, endometriosis, or low AMH may also have problems conceiving.

In men, low sperm count is common issue. They may not know until tests are done. Other signs include erectile dysfunction, low libido, or swelling in testicles. If thereâ€™s history of mumps or injury to groin area, it may also affect sperm.

But donâ€™t panic. Not all issues mean permanent infertility. Many couples just have unexplained infertility, which means no clear reason. Still, IVF or IUI helps.

If you're noticing any of these signs, itâ€™s better to talk to a fertility expert. Ayuh Fertility Centre in Ahmedabad checks both husband and wife and gives simple advice first.
